<h1>My Hobby Is </h1>
<h2>Playing Music</h2>
<p>My hobby is playing music. My father bought me a keyboard when I was 5 years old and ever since then I have been learning how to play music. When I moved to Australia, my father bought me a Guitar and also made me join Guitar lessons. Later it didn't work out so I quit Guitar. But then I joined the band which was part of my school in Australia and every Monday I went at 7:45 am and played different instruments for different pieces of Music. My dream is to become a musician when I grow up and I hope that when I create many pieces of Music, everybody will love to listen and play my creations.</p>
